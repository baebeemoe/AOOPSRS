                <p>All actors can view their details, view attendance records, submit leave requests, view leave request status, submit disputes, and view payslips. Both the payroll and HR staff can view employee lists and employee attendance. The difference between the two admins is that only the payroll admin has the capabilities or access to calculate employee salary, calculate deductions, and view payroll reports. By keeping up-to-date banking information and accurately reporting working hours, the employee lays the foundation for a smooth payroll process. The ability for employees to have an active role in the payroll ecosystem enables them to submit accurate timesheets, notify their employer as soon as personal data changes, and comprehend pay scales and deductions. The HR administrator shall liaise between the payroll system and employees.  By processing and verifying employee data, they guarantee the accuracy and completeness of information. The HR administrator manages everything from introducing new employees to benefits such as leave management, which is crucial in efficient payroll processing. The payroll administrator under the finance department produces paychecks, balances accounts, and compiles reports. The IT division is essential to the implementation and data migration processes, system integration, performance monitoring, and other access.
