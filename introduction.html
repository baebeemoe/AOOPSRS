                 <h2>1.2 Project Scope</h2>
                 <br>
                 <p>The scope of the MotorPH Payroll System encompasses the entire payroll process within the organization. This includes managing employee information, tracking attendance, calculating salaries, generating payslips, and ensuring compliance with relevant tax and labor regulations. The scope excludes tasks unrelated to payroll processing, such as general human resources management or unrelated financial processes. The system will comply with specified technologies and frameworks as outlined in the project constraints. Databases, communication protocols, programming languages, and other technologies selected for different components are all well documented here. As a result, choices can be made with knowledge, and system compatibility is guaranteed.

                <h2>1.2 Business Goals </h2>
                 <br>
                 <p>The system will comply with specified technologies and frameworks as outlined in the project constraints. The proposed system will give MotorPHâ€™s actors and stakeholders proper authentication, employee information organization, time and attendance tracking, automated salary calculation, payroll reporting, and dispute resolution system. Aligning these with reliability, scalability, and great security. Integration with a database is also a MUST. Setting these fundamental components as your top priorities will help you make sure your payroll system application performs its critical function of protecting sensitive data, optimizing HR procedures, and delivering accurate and timely paychecks. Below are the non-functional requirements provided.
